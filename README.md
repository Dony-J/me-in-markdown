## Introduction 

Hi, my name is Donovan Jones, and I am a sophomore this year. A little about me is that I enjoy riding motorcycles,playing golf, and that I play baseball. My movie is “Good Will Hunting” because one of my favorite actors is Robin Williams, and the movie is so empowering. To me this movie shows that anyone has the potential to find themselves and build on themselves. Over the summer, I had the chance to travel a little bit. I got to go to Yosemite National Park. One of my favorite foods I enjoy is sushi and I had it quite a bit this summer. This food is special to me because I tried it when I was little and it has been my favorite ever since.

Recently, I have learned how to hunt, and I am proud that I got to achieve my official hunter safety license over the summer. A fun fact about me is that I love music and I don't have a specific type of music that I listen to, I listen to almost all genres. Outside of school, I like to spend my time practicing baseball. I play on the team at school. One of my most memorable summer experiences was playing baseball over the summer and being able to train and build up my strength to throw harder and more accurately. I also spent time with friends. I went camping a lot this summer with my friends which made my summer even better.

Looking ahead to this school year, my goals are to learn/obtain new information and also pass my classes. In this computer science class, I hope to learn more about coding and pass my AP test. My family has some traditions, we celebrate Christmas and Hunnukah each year, which always means a lot to me. These experiences have inspired me to think about my future, and one of my aspirations is to, if possible, be able to continue playing baseball and attend a good college.
